<p>Hello, ths is Seoyoung!</p>

<p>I am pursuing an MS in Information Management with a Data Science specialization at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I have also gained exposure to other fields of study, such as sociology and mathematics, through overseas exchange programs. My goal is to leverage my analytical acumen and creative problem-solving skills to bring data-driven insights to the forefront of business and societal challenges.</p>

<p>I have a strong proficiency in Python, which I have used to instruct online courses, develop course materials, and analyze blockchain transactional data in my previous roles as a Python Instructor at Coding Valley and a Data Research Analyst at Oneall&amp;Partners. I have also earned certifications in big data analytics, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and expertise in relevant technologies.</p>
